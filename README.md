# WordCountAPI

A simple API made with ASP.NET Web API
The API has a single endpoint to which a client can upload a text file. 
The server processes the text file, finds the most used words and surrounds them
with the words "foo" and "bar" and then returns the processed text to the user. 

How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the solution using Visual Studio. 
3. A simple html page will be started at localhost:56793 for testing the API
